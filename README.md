Part 1: 

Part 2: For Assignment 8, I decided to create a portfolio website for myself. The purpose of this website is to allow others to get to know me better and reach out if they want to connect. In my portfolio website, it contains my skills, a short biography, and a contact page with a form and links to my social accounts. This gives the user some quick general information about me and information to reach out. To make my portfolio website more engaging to the user, I decided to take a modern minimalistic approach to the design. When the page first loads, a short introduction written by a typewriter is animated. In order to ensure that the user understands their mouse is hovering over, every possible button selection has some sort of indication that shows the user what is being selected. I implemented a navigation bar, and it would underline the menu item that is selected if the mouse hovered over it. Additionally, at the contact page, the user is notified if they select the text box in the contact form or the links to the social media accounts. The target audience for my portfolio website is mainly for employers and people who are interested to get to know me a little and connect. 

Part 3:       
* When the page loads 
  * The About Me button 
    * When you hover over the navigation bar, the color changes and it leads to the About Me page, which can also be accessed on the navigation bar. 
  * The Navigation Bar
    * When you hover over any of the menu items, the selected item is underlined and leads you to any of the pages based on the menu item selected 
* Contact Page 
  * The Contact Form 
    * The user is able to fill out the form and is notified which textbox based on the changing border colors. The border changes color from white to black as it gets selected. 
  * Social Media Buttons 
    * The user can hover over the buttons as it expands to what social media account it is. It is also linked to my social media accounts so the user just has to click on the social media account they want to see. 

Part 4: 
An external tool I used for my portfolio website is animation. I decided to use it because it would help make the website more interactive, making it more engaging for the user. Since all portfolio websites are just information, in order for the user to be more interested in getting to know you, animation is needed. I used animation mainly on my home page and the contact page. The navigation bar is on every page and the contact page allows the user to switch between the pages. I also used it on the hovering and expanding of the social media buttons and the contact form on the contact page. All these animations make the website more modern and interactive. It lets the user know what items are being selected while also being simple.

Part 5: 
I did not change much of my mockups from HW 7. Most of the design changes were similar except the background page and how the user would be able to see my social media accounts. 

Part 6: 
A major challenge for my experience in implementing my portfolio website was getting the animation to correctly work. The animation seemed simple in use, but there are many events and structures that need to work together before in order to achieve the animation that I desired.
