    <h2> Who I am </h2>
    <p> Hi, my name is Jeff Bao and I'm currently a rising junior at Carnegie Mellon University Tepper School of Business.
      I am majoring in Business Administration with a minor in Human-Computer Interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since childhood, I have always enjoyed playing and listening to music. Growing up in a family of musicians, I was surrounded by music almost everyday.
      I am definitely glad that I learned music because it taught me many valuable life-lessons and heavily influenced my life.
      Currently, I am part of Carnegie Mellon University's All University Orchestra.
      Knowing the positive impact music has had on my life, I hope to share its benefits and potential to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      CMU has a wide diversity of people, who all have their unique thoughts and opinions.
      Because of this, I have been fortunate enough to learn from and also be friends with them.
      I am always looking for opportunity to meet new people, and I am excited to see who I will meet on my path.
